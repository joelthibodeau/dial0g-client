## Full-Stack Project • front-end ##

### Description ###

dial0g is web application that lets a user log entry names by date into a databse
and give them a numeric rating. It's a shorthand diary for storing opinions/feelings
about experiences and things. Once a user has signed up with an email address, they can
sign in and begin creating records.

### Technologies ###

dialog is my second project in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.
I used JavaScript, CSS/Sass, HTML5, jQuery and Bootstrap to build the front-end, and
Ruby on Rails along with heroku for the back-end to create this single page application.

### Planning & Future Iterations ###

The current version of dial0g is a work in progress. The original plan was to incorporate
and dial/knob using jQuery that the user could operate with a mouse or trackpad to
set the rating of an entry on scale of 1 to 10. When the user retrieves entries, ratings
are represented by the knob setting originally saved providing easy to read visual feedback.
Both the front-end and back-end took longer than expected and I wasn't able to create
working knob for the deadline. I plan to add this feature in the future so that the
user's experience is more meaningful. Additionally, the application has been scaffolded to
accept notes from the user and the form field will be added in a future iteration.
